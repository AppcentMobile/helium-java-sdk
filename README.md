A Java SDK for [Helium Blockchain APIs](https://docs.helium.com/api/blockchain/introduction/). 

Easily integrate to Helium Blockhain API in your java applications for `Android`, `Backend`, `Console`...

The SDK is based on `Java 1.8` uses the following dependencies:

* OkHttp3
* Gson  

# Usage

## Installation

> **TODO**: Update here after GithubRepository integration.

The SDK is not available on any maven repository yet. Currently only way to include it in your projects is by copying the source code. 

When we feel comfortable on releasing first alpha, it will be available on a maven repository.

## Initialization

Create an instance by calling the constructor of `HeliumApi`.

```java
HeliumApi heliumApi = new HeliumApi();
```

If you need more configuration, use `HeliumApi(OkHttpClient client)`.

## Accessing APIs in a Type-Safe way

Access the Blockchain APIs like `hotspots`, `accounts` and `rewards` through corresponding methods of the `HeliumApi` instance. The SDK uses builder pattern to create requests. And it is possible to get the response through the synchronous `execute()` call.

```java
HotspotResponse resp = heliumApi.hotspots().searchHotspotsByLocationBox()
    .nelat(0)
    .nelon(0)
    .swlat(4f)
    .swlon(5f)
    .execute();
```

## Pagination

Some of the APIs return results in pages. In order to fetch multiple pages you should transfer previous response's `cursor` property to the next request. Currently, this is responsibility of the SDK user. 

```java
HeliumApi heliumApi = new HeliumApi();

HotspotsResponse firstPage = heliumApi.hotspots().getHotspots().execute();
HotspotsResponse secondPage = heliumApi.hotspots().getHotspots().cursor(firstPage.cursor).execute();

System.out.println(secondPage.data);
```
